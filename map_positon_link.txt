Udacity DAND P3 project submission

A text file containing a link to the map position you wrangled in your project, a short description of the area and a reason for your choice.
I chose the Austin, Texas area for this project because I am new to this area and thought this project may assist in my exploring this town. I requested a custom download from Mapzen for this project. The link to the file is embedded below.
